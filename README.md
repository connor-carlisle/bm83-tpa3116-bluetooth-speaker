## Overview

This board is a fully integrated stereo Bluetooth speaker driver: it receives a Bluetooth audio stream, decodes it on the BM83 module, and drives a pair of speakers through a Class D amplifier — all on a single ~100 × 100 mm PCB.

The design is intentionally compact and inexpensive to fabricate (single-board, 2-layer, hand-solderable footprints throughout) while still respecting the discipline a mixed-signal RF audio board demands: clean separation of analog and high-current ground domains, careful output filtering on the Class D amplifier, and a defined antenna keep-out zone for the BM83's integrated chip antenna.

## Design decisions

### Why the BM83
The BM83 is a fully-certified Bluetooth audio module — the alternative was building a Bluetooth stack on a bare BT chip, which is dramatically more work for a personal project and requires going through Bluetooth SIG certification. The BM83 ships with a complete stack, a stereo audio path, and an integrated chip antenna in a small footprint. The trade-off is less flexibility and a higher cost per unit, but it is the right choice for a single-board portfolio piece.

### Why the TPA3116D2DAD
Industry-standard Class D amplifier with strong documentation, stereo BTL configuration in a single chip, and well-understood thermal behavior. The DAD-suffix package (HTSSOP with PowerPad) is easier to hand-assemble than the alternative DAP package while still providing adequate thermal performance for the target output level.

### Power architecture
A single supply input feeds the TPA3116 directly and is regulated down to 3.3 V by an LM1117-3.3 LDO for the BM83. An MCP111T-270E/TT reset supervisor holds the BM83 in reset until the 3.3 V rail crosses its threshold, ensuring clean power-on-reset behavior. An LDO was chosen over a switcher for the BM83 supply specifically to avoid injecting switching noise into the Bluetooth radio's PLL.

### BTL output filter
The Class D switching outputs need an LC filter before reaching the speakers. Without one, you radiate the switching frequency directly through the speaker leads — which act as antennas — and you cause both EMI compliance problems and audible distortion. The filter is sized for the audio bandwidth and the target speaker impedance.

### Mixed-signal grounding
The board uses an **SGND / GND star ground** scheme: the analog return from the BM83 audio output and the high-current return from the speaker terminals are kept on separate copper pours and joined at a single point near the connector. Without this separation, speaker-current-induced ground bounce modulates the analog reference and shows up as audible noise in the amplified output.

### Antenna placement
The BM83's chip antenna is placed at the **board edge** with **copper pour exclusion** in the keep-out zone defined by the BM83 datasheet. Putting copper pour under or near the antenna detunes it and crushes the radiation pattern. This is one of those layout rules that's easy to miss but completely changes whether your Bluetooth actually works at usable range.

## Viewing the design

Don't have Altium? You can still inspect everything:

- **[Schematic (PDF)](outputs/pdf/schematic.pdf)** — full hierarchical schematic
- **[Fabrication drawing (PDF)](outputs/pdf/fabrication-drawing.pdf)** — board outline, layer stack, mechanical dimensions
- **[Bill of materials](outputs/bom/)**
- **[3D renders](images/)**

To open the source files, clone the repo and open `altium/PCB1.PrjPcb` in Altium Designer (a free Altium Education license is available for students).

## Manufacturing

The Gerber set in `outputs/gerbers/` is fab-ready and tested-friendly with JLCPCB, PCBWay, and most North American fabs. Default specifications:

- 2-layer FR-4
- 1.6 mm thickness
- 1 oz copper
- HASL or ENIG finish

Most components are stocked at Digi-Key and Mouser. The BM83 has occasional supply constraints — check stock before placing an order.

## Status

- ✅ Design complete, schematic ERC clean
- ✅ Manufacturing outputs generated
- 🔲 Boards ordered / assembled
- 🔲 Bring-up and validation

## Lessons learned

A few things that came out of this design that I'd carry forward to the next revision:

- **Reset supervisor is non-negotiable.** An earlier iteration tied the BM83 reset pin to the 3.3 V rail through a simple pull-up. The MCP111T was added after observing the BM83 occasionally powering up into an undefined state on slow rail rise. Explicit POR handling is cheap and worth it.
- **Star grounding paid off.** Iterations with a single solid GND plane showed audible noise on the speakers that correlated with bass-heavy content — high-current speaker returns were modulating the analog reference. Splitting SGND from GND and tying them at a single point cleared it.
- **Antenna keep-out matters.** The first layout had ground pour right up to the BM83 antenna. Pulling the pour back to the manufacturer-defined keep-out improved Bluetooth range noticeably.
